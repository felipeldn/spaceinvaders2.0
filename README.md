SPACE INVADERS -
A game based on the classic Space Invaders.

Players can move up, down, left, right, and are able to shoot missiles. Once an alien enemy makes contact with the player's ship, the game is over and the player can see his/her score. 

Motivation -
I was very keen to move away from building application which pertain to blogs, etc. and move on to something more challenging. My passion for gaming also played its part.
